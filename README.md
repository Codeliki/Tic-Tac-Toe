‚ñ∂Ô∏è Variables and Constants: The game initializes variables for game elements (cells, status text, restart button), win conditions, the game state (options array), the current player, and a running state to control the game flow.<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏è InitializeGame Function: This function sets up the game by attaching click event listeners to each cell and the restart button, setting the initial status text, and marking the game as running.<br>

‚ô¶Ô∏è Game Mechanics<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Function: Triggered when a cell is clicked. It checks if the cell is already filled or if the game is not running. If neither condition is met, it updates the cell with the current player's symbol and checks for a winner.<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏èupdateCell Function: Updates the game state and the cell's text content with the current player's symbol.<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏èchangePlayer Function: Toggles the current player between "X" and "O" and updates the status text to indicate whose turn it is.<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏ècheckWinner Function: Iterates through predefined win conditions to check if any have been met. If a player wins, it updates the status text with the winner and stops the game. If there's a draw (no empty cells left), it declares a draw. Otherwise, it changes the player.<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏èrestartGame Function: Resets the game state, game board, and status text, and sets the game to running.<br>

Each cell should also have a unique cellIndex attribute used to identify it.
